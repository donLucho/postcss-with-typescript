# PostCSS with Typescript

## Description
Experimenting with Jenkins for use with a front-end project.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is two-fold: 1) get exposed to using and configuring PostCSS in the context of a React project; and, 2) to use a building-block for other future endeavours which likely will include the inevitable "Jenkins" configuration for enhanced development workflow. Jenkins, truly, is the main focus of this project; React is just the vehicle.

## Sources of Creative Motivation
There are several sources, indeed, that forced my hand to explore the original theme more than I had anticipated. These sources include but are not limited to lessons presented by several different authors:
  - [Nana&rsquo;s playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy7NrYWoggjw_LIiDK1LXdNN82uYuuuiC "link to youtube") called **&quot;Jenkins Tutorial for Beginners&quot;** on YouTube;
  - The original getting started tutorial entitled [&quot;Build a Node.js and React app with npm&quot;](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/ "link to Jenkins") found in the official documentation at Jenkins;
  - an enthralling lesson entitled [&quot;How To Automate Jenkins Setup with Docker and Jenkins Configuration as Code&quot;](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-automate-jenkins-setup-with-docker-and-jenkins-configuration-as-code "link to Digital Ocean") by the folks at Digital Ocean that was too good to resist.

The subject of Jenkins is only as interesting or boring that you intend on making it. The learning curve is somewhat steep, however, once you find your bearings I&rsquo;d venture to say that you begin to walk in stride on &quot;Easy Street.&quot;

## It is the self&#45;same project repeated twice&hellip;
At each **Gitlab** and **Github** I present two comparable projects that are identical; the only difference between *each set of two* is that one is constructed with *the default configuration* while the other utilizes *Typescript* under the hood.
